# zephyrus-store (support SM 1.10).
My rewritten zephyrus store

Store system for CS:GO.
Zephyrus store system rewritten with preview support (compilable with SM 1.10) 

Not support for compile in SM 1.11

Since this is zephyrus's store that was rewritten so any custom module that support zephyrus store can also be run without any problem. Contact me if you find any bugs or error.

Update 18/3: Re-add tf2 item support (I dont know this is gonna work or not). Please fell free to create a new issue post for bug report.

P/S: Note. Store mainly supported for csgo, any others game (css, l4d2) may have some module that need to rework to be able to use. I will rework any that needed and will store in `<game_name>_modules` folders. Check for it (if you see no item that store in that folder, which mean any module on the main scripting folder are all available to use)
