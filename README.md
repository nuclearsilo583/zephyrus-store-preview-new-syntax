# zephyrus-store (support SM 1.10 and SM 1.11).
WARNING: THERE ARE MANY WARNING ABOUT RETURN VALUE IN NEWEST 1.11 COMPILER AND YOU CAN IGNORE THOSE.

My rewritten zephyrus store

Store system is mainly support for CS:GO.

P/S: Note. Store mainly supported for csgo, any others game (css, l4d2) may have some module that need to rework to be able to use. I will rework any that needed and will store in `<game_name>_modules` folders. Check for it (if you see no item that store in that folder, which mean you need to install any you wish from the main scripting folder and test run if you may find any error.)
